# Taxi-Ridesharing

Suppose that you are a taxi service operator with an unlimited number of taxis. You are given a set of trip requests by different passengers. Each request consists of a pickup location and a dropoff location.
Your goal is to serve every passenger, while minimizing the total travel distance of occupied taxis. Assume that taxis travel in direct paths between locations, and disregard rides without passengers. Also ignore temporal aspects, e.g., assume that passengers do not care about pickup and dropoff times.
Task 1: Baseline
If each taxi can carry only up to 1 passenger, what is the minimum total travel distance?
Task 2: Ride Sharing
Now, assume that each taxi can carry up to 2 passengers at once. That is, a taxi may pickup one passenger, then travel to pick up a second passenger, and proceed to dropoff the two passengers in any order.
